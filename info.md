## Description

This course will explore current statistical techniques for the automatic analysis of natural (human) language data. The dominant modeling paradigm is corpus-driven statistical learning.  This term, we are introducing a few new projects to give increased hands-on experience with a greater variety of NLP tasks and commonly used techniques.

This course assumes a good background in basic machine learning and a strong ability to program in Python. Prior experience with linguistics or natural languages is helpful, but not required.  There will be a lot of statistics, algorithms, and coding in this class.  The recommended background is CS 188 (or CS 281A) and CS 170 (or CS 270).  An A in CS 188 (or CS 281A) is required.  This course will be more work-intensive than most graduate or undergraduate courses.

## Readings

The primary recommended texts for this course are:

- Jurafsky and Martin, Speech and Language Processing, [3rd edition](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/).
- Eisenstein, [Introduction to Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class/blob/master/notes/eisenstein-nlp-notes.pdf)

Note that M&S is free online if you access it from campus.  Also, make sure you get the purple 2nd edition of J+M, not the white 1st edition.
