## Description

This course will explore current statistical techniques for the automatic analysis of natural (human) language data. The dominant modeling paradigm is corpus-driven statistical learning, with a split focus between supervised and unsupervised methods.  This term, we are introducing a few new projects to give increased hands-on experience with a greater variety of NLP tasks and commonly used techniques.

This course assumes a good background in basic probability and a strong ability to program in Java. Prior experience with linguistics or natural languages is helpful, but not required.  There will be a lot of statistics, algorithms, and coding in this class.  The recommended background is CS 188 (or CS 281A) and CS 170 (or CS 270).  An A in CS 188 (or CS 281A) is required.  This course will be more work-intensive than most graduate or undergraduate courses.

## Readings

The primary recommended texts for this course are:

    - Jurafsky and Martin, Speech and Language Processing, 2nd edition ONLY [[amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Language-Processing-Prentice-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/0131873210)]
